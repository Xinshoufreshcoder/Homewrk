# Requiement
The task is to transform the Floyd algorithm from an iterative approach to recursion. For detailed requirements, please refer to "requirement.text".

# Start
First, copy the code from the PDF to Visual Studio Code and ensure that necessary packages are installed, for example: import sys; import itertools

Next, perform a test run of the code to verify if the copying and pasting is done correctly. After completing this step, conduct a test run of the code and record the results. Since the result of this run serves as the expected outcome for checking the recursive version of the code later on, if the results of the recursive version match those of the iterative version, then the rewritten recursive code for Floyd is successful and has also passed the function test.

# Result
[[0, 7, 12, 8], [9223372036854775807, 0, 5, 7], [9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807, 0, 2], [9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807, 0]]

#Test
The recursive version code for Floyd with two functions, has passed the test as its execution results in Visual Studio Code match those of the iterative functions. They are the same results.
